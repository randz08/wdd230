            that manage vacation rental properties and are represented in their local currency. A “vacation rental
            property” is defined as a home, house, villa, condo, apartment, townhouse or other residence, managed by a
            vacation rental property management company that is booked through the respective toll-free dedicated
            vacation rental reservation line, the applicable website, or through the vacation rental management
            companies' dedicated reservations phone number. Currency may be converted at this site, however, this
            service is provided for convenience only. We base international currency conversion on publicly available
            sources, so we do not warrant or guarantee that conversion rates are accurate or will be the same at the
            time you pay the hotel. Your payments to hotels or vacation rental management companies on this site are
            matters to be resolved solely between you and the hotel or vacation rental management company, and we do not
            assume any liability or involvement in disputes you may have with a hotel or vacation rental management
            company. Hotels or vacation rental management companies may change price and availability of rooms listed on
            this site without notice.</p>

        <p>You agree that you will only make legitimate reservations in good faith for use by you and your invited
            guests only, and not for other purposes, including reselling, impermissibly assigning or posting on third
            party websites, or making speculative, false or fraudulent reservations, or any reservation in anticipation
            of demand.</p>

            learns of the resale of rooms, all reservations booked in the resellers name may be cancelled at Choice's

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>

            affiliates, distributors, franchisees, vacation rental management companies, and licensees harmless from and
            against any judgment, losses, deficiencies, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
            attorneys' fees and expenses of counsel selected by Temples Inn & Suites) incurred in connection with or
            arising from any claim, demand, suit, action, or proceeding arising out of your breach of these Terms of Use
            or in connection with your use of this site or any product or service related to this site.</p>
        <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>We create and control this site in the State of Maryland, U.S.A. Accordingly, Maryland law governs these
            Terms of Use, without regard to Maryland conflicts of law principles. In the event that there is a dispute,
            claim or controversy between you and Temple Inn & Suites, or between you and any third-party acting on our
            behalf, arising out of or relating to your use of the website, your reservation or stay at any of
            our-affiliated hotels, federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, these Terms, Temple Inn &
            Suites' Privacy Policy, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof,
            including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such dispute,
            claim or controversy will be determined by arbitration in Rockville, MD before one arbitrator. The
            arbitration will be administered by JAMS. For claims greater than $250,000, the JAMS Comprehensive
            Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced will apply. For claims
            less than or equal to $250,000, the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration
            is commenced will apply. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the Maryland, exclusive of its
            conflict or choice of law rules. Nothing in this paragraph will preclude the parties from seeking
            provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge
            that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in
            this paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16)
            will govern any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms. Either party may commence arbitration by
            providing to JAMS and the other party to the dispute a written demand for arbitration, setting forth the
            subject of the dispute and the relief requested (“Arbitration Demand”).</p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the parties agrees that any proceeding, whether in
            arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
            representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each
            party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim
            arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The appointed
            arbitrator may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the state law designated above. In
            making his or her determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term or provision
            of these Terms. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned written decision with respect to the dispute (the
            “Award”) to each party, who will promptly act in accordance the Award. Any Award (including interim or final
            remedies) may be confirmed or enforced in any court having jurisdiction, including any court having
            jurisdiction over either party or its assets. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on
            the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review. Each party will advance one-half of the fees and
            expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the attendance of the court reporter at the arbitration hearing,
            and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, the
            arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the
            prevailing party in connection with that aspect of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any
            opposing awards of costs and attorneys’ fees awards will be offset. The parties will maintain the
            confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the Award, except as may be necessary to
            prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection
            with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an Award or its enforcement, or unless
            otherwise required by any applicable law. Any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration
            hereunder will be treated as confidential by the parties, witnesses and arbitrators, and will not be
            disclosed to any third person (other than witnesses or experts), except as required by any applicable law or
            except if such evidence was obtained from the public domain or is otherwise obtained independently of the
            arbitration.</p>
